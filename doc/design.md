## NOTES


If you want to have description on several lines, you can use quotes.
You can also use the following separators: -- .. == __. And you can put titles within the separators. 



## PlantUML Limitations


- For a "package" you cannot changed border link Style. Rectangle has `rectangleBorderStyle dashed` but there is note one for package
- I would like to Left align text in the border to the type right. However, it will not allow that.
